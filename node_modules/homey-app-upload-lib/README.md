# Homey App Upload

CLI tool and library to make developing apps for the [Homey home automation](http://athom.com) platform a bit easier.

The purpose is to allow for incremental app updates to be pushed to Homey during app development.

## Installation

This tool consists of two parts: a library that you need to include in your Homey app, and a CLI (command line interface) tool that you should install on the computer you are developing on.

### Library

#### Installation

```bash
$ cd path-to-your-homey-app
$ npm install homey-app-upload-lib
```

#### Usage

The library needs to be initialized from the `onInit` method of your app, and should be passed your app's manifest as an argument:

```javascript
const HomeyAppUpload = require('homey-app-upload-lib');

...

class YourHomeyApp extends Homey.App {
  onInit() {
    HomeyAppUpload(this.manifest);
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Remarks:
* The library requires the `homey:manager:api` permission, and will refuse to run when it isn't set.
* The library should not be used in published apps.
* At the moment, only one app can have an uploader active.

### CLI

#### Installation

```bash
$ npm install homey-app-upload-cli -g
```

#### Usage

```
homey-app-upload â€“ Homey App Upload

Usage:
  homey-app-upload [options] upload

Options:
  -h --help                     Show this screen
  --version                     Show version
  -i --incremental              Perform incremental updates
  -I --incremental-file=<file>  File to use for incremental update metadata
  -u --url=<url>                Homey Uploader Server URL
  -n --no-restart               Don't restart app after changes have been uploaded
  --dry-run                     Just show which files would have been uploaded
  -v --verbose                  More verbose output

Instead of passing -u, you can set an environment variable HOMEY_APP_UPLOAD_URL
that contains the URL for the upload server:

    export HOMEY_APP_UPLOAD_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5481/
```

First, run `athom project --run` to upload the app to Homey initially. Keep it running, and open another window/terminal from which to run (incremental) updates using this CLI tool.

By default, the CLI tool uploads the entire app. It will take into account `.gitignore` and `.homeyignore` files to determine which files to ignore.

##### Incremental updates

If you want incremental updates, use the `-i` option:

```
$ homey-app-upload -i upload
```

Incremental updates work by checking the timestamp of a metadata file (`--incremental-file`) against the files and directories in the app directory. Only the changed files will be uploaded, typically reducing the upload time significantly when compared to uploading the entire app.

##### App restarts

After uploading, the default action is to restart the app. This can be prevented using the `-n/--no-restart` option.
